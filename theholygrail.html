<b>2004HQ - The Holy Grail</b><br>
<br>
Description: King Arthur is sending out his knights on a quest for the famous Holy Grail. If you are a Knight of the Round Table, go to King Arthur for further orders.<br>
<br>
<b>Difficulty Level: <font color="Red">Hard</font></b><br>
<br>
Items/Skills Needed To Start: You MUST be a Knight of the Round Table (you must have done the Merlin's Crystal quest), some good armor and a weapon, and possibly one or two prayer restore potions if you have level 43 prayer (which is strongly suggested); one or two cure poison potions would help.<br>
<br>
Starting Location: Camelot Castle<br>
<br>
Reward: 2 Quest points, about 5-10k defense experience, and 10750 prayer experience, or possibly more or less depending on your prayer level.<br>
<br>
Instructions:<br>
<br>
Talk to King Arthur in the Castle in Camelot. He will tell you that he wants you to go on a quest to retrieve the Holy Grail and that for more details you should talk to Merlin.<br>
<br>
Go up the stairs and go into the lab and talk to Merlin. He will tell you about Sir Galahad who lives west of McGrubor's woods.<br>
<br>
Go to Brother Galahad who lives in a house directly west of McGrubor's woods. Talk to him. He will tell you about how he once found the Grail by accident but it didn't feel right to take the Grail from its home so he left it there.<br>
<br>
Now you must go to Port Sarim and take a boat ride to Entrana Island; make sure you don't have any weapons or armor with you.<br>
<br>
Once you are on Entrana go to the church and talk to the High Priest. Tell him that you are interested in finding the Holy Grail. The Crone will interrupt and will start talking to you and about the Fisher King. She will tell you that the Fisher King is in pain and you must blow the whistle where all six heads point to. Also ask her about the whistle and about how to get it.<br>
<br>
Now go back to Brother Galahad. Talk to him and try to get him to give you an item. He will give you a Holy Table Napkin.<br>
<br>
Go to Draynor Manor, located directly north of Draynor Village. Go to the top floor and go to the room all the way south. You must have the napkin in your inventory or you will not be able to see the Magic Whistle. Pick up two Magic Whistles as you will need a second later on in the quest.<br>
<br>
Now you must get ready to kill the level 126 Black Knight Titan. You should have a prayer level of 43 so you can use protect from melee. You must bring along your Excalibur from the Merlin's Crystal quest. If you do not have it for any reason, you will need to get another by talking to the Lady of the Lake. You will need this to finish off the knight.<br>
<br>
Once you are done preparing you must go to Brimhaven. Once you are there head all the way west, until you get to the poison scorpions. Once you get to the poison scorpions, head toward the north. Past the horseshoe shape of gold ore rocks is a platform on stilts. Simply stand under it and blow the whistle.<br>
<br>
Now it is time to kill the Black Knight Titan. Just head west and talk to the knight. Now just fight the knight and kill him. This is the hardest part of the whole quest.<br>
<br>
Now head towards the small peninsula. Once you cross the bridge, the fisherman is just to the southeast. Talk to the fisherman and ask him how to get inside the castle that you are next to. He will tell you to pick up one of the bells and ring it.<br>
<br>
Go west of the fisherman and you will see the castle. A Grail Bell is lying outside the wall to the northwest. Ring it and a Grail Maiden will bring you into the castle.<br>
<br>
Climb up the central staircase and then go to the room to the east to speak to the Fisher King. He asks you to find his son Percival, a Knight of the Round Table, and return him to his father's castle.<br>
<br>
Now you must go to Camelot (blow the whistle to get out of the castle).<br>
<br>
Once you are in Camelot, talk to King Arthur and ask him about the Fisher King's son Percival. He will give you a magical feather that will guide you to the place you want to go.<br>
<br>
To make this faster just go to Goblin Village and go inside the hut that is all the way on your right (east). Right click on the sacks and prod them and then right click to open them. Sir Percival will escape and talk to you, taking the spare whistle to use to re-enter his father's castle.<br>
<br>
Return to the Fisher King's Castle. You notice that the countryside is green and growing again and that the Black Knight Titan is gone. Enter the castle through the door and go up the central staircase to find that Percival is now king. Talk to him to receive his thanks.<br>
<br>
Go back down the central staircase and make your way to the eastern tower. Climb the staircase and then the ladder. Take the Holy Grail.<br>
<br>
Go back to Camelot and talk to King Arthur to receive your reward.<br>
