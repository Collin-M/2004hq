His wife, Alrena will tell you about the city and that you will need a mask to get into the city. She will make you a mask if you have a dwellberry. If you have the dwellberry, talk to her again and she will give you a mask. She will tell you about her husband who is digging the garden and ask you to help him. Before talking to Edmond, get the picture of Elena which is inside the house on the table.<br>
<br>
<br>
The garden is just west of this house. Talk to Edmond and he will say that you will need to pour some water on the soil. Use 4 buckets of water on the Mud patch and use the spade on the mud patch. You and Edmond will fall into the sewer.<br>
<br>
