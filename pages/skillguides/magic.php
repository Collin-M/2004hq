                <p>Pointing at the spell book item brings up the magic menu. From here you can select spells to cast.
                    <p>This will bring up a screen of all spells available to you within the game. If the picture of a spell is darkened, it means that you do not yet have a high enough level to cast it or you do not have the runes in your inventory to do
                        so. If a spell is lit up on this screen, then it means that you are a high enough level to cast it and you have enough runes in your inventory.
                        <p>To cast the spell just click on the spell picture, and then click on your desired target in the main game window. Some spells can only be cast on hostile monsters, other spells can only be cast on yourself or inventory items, so
                            experiment to see what targets are valid for each spell.
                            <p>For more information on a spell move your mouse cursor over the spell. A description of the spell and a list of which are runes are required is shown at the bottom of the window. Each required rune has 2 numbers shown below
                                a picture of it. The 1st number indicates how many of that rune you have, and the 2nd number indicates how many you require. The numbers will be drawn in red for runes which you do not have a sufficient number of to cast
                                the spell. Runes can be obtained in a number of ways. Mages can make their own runes using the runecrafting skill (see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051124054610/http://www.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/skills/runecraft.ws"
                                class="c">runecrafting</a> guide). Other ways to get runes include buying them in magic shops in towns such as Varrock and Port Sarim or by killing monsters.
